WIP/Feature Requests:

1- Option to delete the contents of the TVshowlist, shows, and Movies tables so they can be populated with fresh date. This will be used in future when we add columns or support for currently unsupported characters. 

1a- Add reset that drops tables mentioned in #1 and rebuilds them with current setup. This will be used in future when we add columns or support for currently unsupported characters. 

2- Rearrange Block. This is a minor request that will be done at some point. 

3- Make sure the Random TV playback mode actually works.

4- Make the spell checking "titlecheck" function smarter. 

5- Improve the setup script so it automatically backups files and downloads latest versions.
